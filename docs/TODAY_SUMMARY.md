# Today's Work Summary - July 6, 2025

## Context
Continued from previous session about organizing documentation and creating automated project setup.

## What We Accomplished Today

### 1. **Documentation Organization System**
- Consolidated 55+ scattered Polish documentation files into organized structure
- Created separation between Atlas brain (consciousness) and project documentation
- Established centralized documentation hub in `.claude/docs-projects/`

### 2. **Automated Project Setup Scripts**
- Created `new-project.sh` (bash) and `new-project.ps1` (PowerShell) 
- Scripts dynamically detect paths (no hardcoding)
- Integrated Atlas brain setup, Task-Master, and WordPress patterns
- Uses proper Windows junctions via `cmd.exe /c "mklink /J"`

### 3. **Windows Junction System**
- Fixed symbolic link issues (Linux `ln -s` doesn't work on Windows)
- Created proper Windows junctions in Atlas pointing to docs-projects
- Junctions: `atlas-[project]/current` â†’ `docs-projects/docs-theme-[project]/current`
- **CONFIRMED USEFUL**: Junctions provide convenient access to project docs from Atlas location

### 4. **Critical Safety Measures**
- Permanently disabled `rm` commands in Claude Code settings
- Created `.deleted` folder for future "deletions" (moves only)
- Added comprehensive documentation with troubleshooting

### 5. **Junction Creation Bug Fixes**
- Fixed junction creation error handling in both bash and PowerShell scripts
- Added proper cleanup of existing junctions before creating new ones
- Improved error reporting with specific mklink error messages

## Current Status
- Automated setup system is complete and functional
- All documentation is properly organized and accessible
- Scripts use dynamic path detection (no hardcoded paths)
- Junction creation now works properly with better error handling

## Pending Issues
1. **Function Links**: Need to fix broken function links in documentation

## Key Files Created/Modified
- `/mnt/c/root/.claude/docs-global/AUTOMATED_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup documentation
- `/mnt/c/root/.claude/.scripts/new-project.sh` - Bash setup script (junction fixes)
- `/mnt/c/root/.claude/.scripts/new-project.ps1` - PowerShell setup script (junction fixes)
- `/mnt/c/root/.claude/config/settings.local.json` - Disabled rm commands
- `/mnt/c/root/DASHBOARD.md` - Updated with correct paths
- `/mnt/c/root/.claude/docs-global/TODAY_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Atlas Brain Locations
- Polish: `.claude/atlas/atlas-polish/`
- TickPulse: `.claude/atlas/atlas-tickpulse/`
- New projects: `.claude/atlas/atlas-[project-name]/`

## Next Session Actions
1. Fix function links in documentation

## Architecture Notes
- Atlas only requires: `WORKING_LOG/`, `MEMORY/`, `SELF/`
- Our organizational folders (`current/`, `development/`, `sessions/`, `archive/`) are useful for Claude to access project docs
- Real documentation lives in `docs-projects/` with junctions in Atlas for convenient access
- Junction system provides best of both worlds: centralized docs + easy Atlas access
